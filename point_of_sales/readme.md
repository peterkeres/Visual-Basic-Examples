# Programming Assignment 2 

**Purpose:**  The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course: 
 - Applying basic GUI design guidelines
 - Creating event-based programs
 - Using variables, loops and selection statements

This assignment will also help you to become more familiar with the following topics:
 - Creating Visual Basic. Net projects
 - Using events in Widgets Visual Basic. Net
 - Using control structures in VB.Net

**Task:** Suppose that you have been tasked to program point of sales. In particular, you’ve been tasked with the development of an interface that given some amount of dollars (change to return from the point of sale), it returns the minimum number of bills/coins that the sales point should return to the buyer. The input of the program is some value in dollars, and the program should output in a ListBox how many coins/bills of each dollar denomination it will return (if they are different than 0), and the total dollar amount for each.

*For example:* 

    suppose that the user types $60. 

    The minimum amount of bills to return is 2, being 1 bill of $50 and $1 bill of 10.  The program then outputs:

    1x$50 = 50
    1x$10 = 10

    Total bills/coins = 2, total disbursed = 60. 

**Your program should assume the following bills/coins:**

Bills: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500, $1,000, $5,000

Coins: 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢, 50¢,  

You should also assume that the point of sale has infinite amount of the bills/coins to give change.

**Criteria for success:** 
 - Submission of a Use Case Definition document.
 - Submission of a Visual Basic.Net project as a .zip file.
 - The program should be implemented in Microsoft Visual Basic.Net.
 - The application calculates correctly the minimum number of bills/coins along with their denomination  
 - The application validates correct input values.
 - The colors in the GUI make good contrast based on the Usability Guidelines.

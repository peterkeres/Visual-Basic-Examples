# Final Project
The objective of this assignment is to develop a software product/solution using the concepts and techniques exposed in the class. Your task is to implement a software that implements a solution to a problem (or a video game if you wish). The software must be implemented in Visual Basic. Net and should make use of GUI.

### Constraints of the project:
- The project can be developed max. in groups of two students. 
- System must make use of multiple screens (at least two).


### Deliverables:
 - By March 16 / 2019 (at most): Project Proposal (1 to 2 pages) which must clearly show the following:
    - Members of Group
    - Problem Statement: Summarize the real-world problem/game and a software solution to the problem.
    - Users and Stakeholders: Explain who the potential users and stakeholders are and how they will interact with the solution.
    - Scope: Specify the scope of the proposed software project. In other words, what aspects of the problem will your software solve, and what will remain as tasks requiring human judgment or work.
    - Prototypes of Screens (can be wireframes or paper and pencil) with storyboards (navigation in your system).
    - Conclusion: Conclude with a persuasive argument as to why the software project would be an appropriate choice for this class.

 - You can submit before this deadline and get my feedback about your project earlier. If you don’t submit by the deadline, you still can develop your project but you will have 0 for 10% of the grade of the project.

 - Submission of project (May 6th , 2019): 
    - Visual Basic project with the software implementation of the project.
    - Video Presentation uploaded to YouTube of the project that includes a power point presentation on the proposed system, what was finally achieved in the project, and a demo of your application (6 minutes on the presentation at most, 4 minutes on the demo of your project.

## My Proposal

### Problem Statement:
it is not uncommon for users to be playing many different games in a close time span. As games have gotten longer and more expansive over the years, it is harder to keep track of the smaller details of a game. Story line, items you have equipped, or goals you need to accomplish. A solution to this problem would be to have a program that will keep track of this information and present it in a way so the user can quickly catch back up to where they had left off. Using a searchable interface, it will Store different sections of notes for different games. Things like story characters, gameplay mechanics, and thoughts about the game. 

### Users and Stakeholders:
An example of potential users who would benefit from this solution would be anyone in the game’s journalism field. Because they must bounce between many projects at one and seeing as they would need to keep notes for the articles they have to write at a later time. Another potential user case would be anyone who plays games sparingly. If a user can only play a game once a week, odds are they would have forgotten what happened during their last session.

### Scope:
This program will solve the problems of keeping your notes organized, making your notes searchable, and presenting your notes in a way so the user can extract information quickly. There will still be aspects of this problem that sill needs human judgment. Making sure that quality notes are entered, gathering the information about the game itself, and making sure that the information entered about the game is accurate. 

### Prototypes and Storyboards:

### Conclusions:
there is two main reason why this project is appropriate for this class. One, is that it tackles one of the principle ideas behind being a computer scientist. Which is automating aspects of our life that would normally be done manually, in this case it would be note taking. The second aspect would be this project also coves the leading reason as to why we have graphical user interfaces. Which is to present data to the user in a way that is intuitive and allows the user to quickly extract information.

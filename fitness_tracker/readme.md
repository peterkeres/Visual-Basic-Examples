# Programming Assignment  1 

**Purpose:**  The purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course: 
 - Applying basic GUI design guidelines
 - Creating event-based programs

This assignment will also help you to become more familiar with the following topics:
 - Creating Visual Basic. Net projects
 - Using events in Widgets Visual Basic. Net
 - Applying type conversions and using variables in VB.Net

**Task:** A fitness track app company has asked you to develop a Windows application using a graphical user interface to determine the total of hours somebody has exercised during their lifetimes, assuming on average a user exercises 2.5 hours per week. When user the app the user will enter:

 - First Name
 - Last Name
 - Birth date (in mm/dd/yyyy)
 - Current date (in mm/dd/yyyy)

The program must display the user’s name and the number of hours the user has exercised in his/her lifetime. The program must output (in a label widget) the user’s name and the number of hours the user has exercised in his/her lifetime. The user can clock a Clear button to clear all entries and results. An Exit button must be available to exit the application.

**Criteria for success:**
 - Submission of a Use Case Definition document.
 - Submission of a Visual Basic.Net project as a .zip file.
 - The program should be implemented in Microsoft Visual Basic.Net.
 - The application calculates correctly the total number of the number of hours the user has exercised.
 - The application validates correct input values.
 - The colors in the GUI make good contrast based on the Usability Guidelines.

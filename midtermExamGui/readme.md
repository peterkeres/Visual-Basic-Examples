# CPSC 3165 GUI Midterm Exam: Practical Part

The goal of this exam is to develop a Fahrenheit/Celsius temperature converter. To achieve this, you must implement the following interface:

To calculate the temperatures use the following formulas:
- F = (9/5 * C) + 32 (where C is the input temperature in Celsius, F is output temp in Fahrenheit)
-  C = (32 â€“ F) * 5/9 (where F is the input temperature in Fahrenheit, C is output temp in Celsius)


The program must accept temperatures that are greater than -273C (-459.4F) inclusively. If the user attempts to type any temperature below this one, the program should present a message box stating that the temperature must be greater than these limits.

Most popular games sold

### Purpose:
This application will open a text file that holds the top 10 selling mobile games. It will allow the user to select a game they want to see the number of units sold. The application will then allow the user to see the total number of units sold for all top 10 mobile games.

### Procedures:
From a window on screen, the user will select from a list what game they want to see the number of units sold for. There will also be a button to display the total units sold for all games.

1.	User Must select a game from a list of choices that is pulled from the text file.
2.	When the user selects a game title, the number of units sold for that game will be displayed.
3.	Only one selection of a game can be made at a time.
4.	If a user selects a different game, the number of units sold for the previous game will be replaced by the new game’s number of units sold. 
5.	When the user wants to see the total number of units sold for all games, a list of all the games in alphabetical order will appear along with their number of units sold. Followed by a grand total.
6.	The user can exit at ether looking at one game or when looking at the grand total.
